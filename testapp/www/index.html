												<p>Maynilad Water Services, Inc. (Maynilad) is the water and wastewater services provider for the 17 cities and municipalities that comprise the West Zone of the Metropolitan Manila area. It is an agent and contractor of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS).</p>
												<p>In 1997, Maynilad was granted a 25-year exclusive concession by the Philippine Government to operate, maintain and invest in the water and sewerage systems in the cities of Manila (all but portions of San Andres and Sta. Ana), Quezon City (west of San Juan River, West Avenue, EDSA, Congressional, Mindanao Avenue, the northern part starting from the Districts of Holy Spirit and Batasan Hills), Makati (west of South Super Highway), Caloocan, Pasay, Parañaque, Las Pinas, Muntinlupa, Valenzuela, Navotas and Malabon, all in Metro Manila; the cities of Cavite, Bacoor and Imus, and the towns of Kawit, Noveleta and Rosario, all in the Province of Cavite.</p>
												<p>The concession term was extended by 15 years in 2010, after Maynilad was required by the Philippine Government to increase and accelerate its wastewater investments. The term extension was reviewed and approved by the MWSS and Department of Finance.</p>

											<div class="content-block">
												<p>Maynilad Water Services, Inc. (Maynilad) was formed in 1997, after the consortium of Benpres Holdings Corporation and Suez Lyonnaise de Eaux won the exclusive right to provide water and wastewater services in the West Zone of Metropolitan Manila.</p>
												<p>Before then, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) was in charge of providing these services.</p>
												<p><strong>A Difficult Start</strong></p>
												<p>Towards the end of 1997, Maynilad struggled to meet its service and financial obligations because of the Asian financial crisis and El Nino phenomenon. These events led to a string of financial, legal and regulatory disputes between Maynilad and MWSS.</p>
												<p>In 2005, Benpres and Suez ceded management and control of Maynilad to MWSS. A competitive bidding was done by the Philippine Government the following year to re-privatize Maynilad.</p>
												<p><strong>Change in Ownership</strong></p>
												<p>DMCI-MPIC Water Company, a joint venture between Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC) and DMCI Holdings, Inc. (DMCI), won the competitive bidding and acquired 83.96% of Maynilad's shares.</p>
												<p>On January 24, 2007, the new owners took over Maynilad and launched an aggressive five-year investment program to rehabilitate the company and its operations.</p>
												<p>In 2013, Marubeni Corporation of Japan acquired a 20% stake in DMCI-MPIC Water Company and became a strategic partner of the Metro Pacific-DMCI consortium.</p>
												<p><strong>Transforming Services, Improving Lives</strong></p>
												<p>Since its re-privatization, Maynilad has spent over P47 billion to improve and expand its water services. As a result, over 9 million people in Valenzuela City down to Cavite City are now enjoying safe, reliable water supply.</p>
												<p>In the coming years, Maynilad will focus on accelerating its wastewater investments, while ensuring the water supply of its current and future customers.</p>

												<p><strong>Water Supply and Facilities Management</strong></p>
												<p><strong>Water Source Analysis </strong>assesses the capability of a water body—in terms of quality and quantity—to supply water to a given area. It also determines the treatment process needed to make raw water suitable for specific uses.</p>
												<p><strong>Hydraulic Model Building and Calibration </strong>uses simulation software to design new water systems and to optimize existing water networks.</p>
												<p><strong>Supply and Pressure Management </strong>optimizes pressure in the distribution system using pressure regulating valves and/or pumping stations.</p>
												<p><strong>Project Management </strong>includes the planning, design, construction, commissioning, and process-proving of water facilities. These services may be availed individually or as a complete package.</p>
												<p><strong>Operation and Maintenance of Water Treatment Plants </strong>involves handling a facility’s day-to-day activities to ensure optimal water treatment. Activities covered include sample collection, selection and handling of appropriate chemicals, preventive and corrective maintenance of electromechanical equipment, and site caretaking.</p>
												
												<p><strong>Water Loss Management</strong></p>
												<p><strong>Rapid Assessment </strong>refers to the study that determines the causes and sources of water loss, and identifies corresponding solutions.</p>
												<p><strong>Leak Detection and Pipe Inspection Services </strong>use advanced equipment to locate non-visible leaks in the pipe lines, thus reducing financial losses linked to water loss.</p>
												<p><strong>Network Maintenance Services </strong>involve the implementation of water loss reduction activities—such as leak repair, valve replacement, installation of new connections, and replacement of water meters.</p>
												<p><strong>Meter Services </strong>include assessment, selection, testing, and calibration of meters to ensure accurate and reliable measurement of water consumption.</p>
												<p><strong>Pipe Rehabilitation Services </strong>include the design and/or implementation of pipe replacement projects to eliminate deteriorated segments of the pipe network.</p>
											
												<p><strong>Geographic Information System Development</strong></p>
												<p><strong>Design of GIS System Architecture </strong>involves the establishment of a database and data model of the Geographic Information System (GIS) to allow the collection and storage of location information with corresponding attributes, enabling multiple users to easily analyze and interpret business data.</p>
												<p><strong>Field Surveying and Mapping </strong>measures and pinpoints the geographical locations of assets for accurate map representation.</p>
												<p><strong>Digitization of Assets </strong>converts geographic data, from a hard copy or scanned image, to vector data. GIS-based maps assist in understanding the attributes, changes, patterns and relationships of geographic features.</p>
												
												<p><strong>Wastewater Management</strong></p>
												<p><strong>Project Management </strong>includes the planning, design, construction, commissioning, and process-proving of wastewater facilities. These services may be availed individually or as a complete package.</p>
												<p><strong>Operation and Maintenance of Sewage Treatment Plants </strong>involves handling a facility’s day-to-day activities. This includes sample collection, selection and handling of appropriate chemicals, preventive and corrective maintenance of electromechanical equipment, and site caretaking.</p>
												<p><strong>Septage Management Program </strong>entails the development of a sanitation program for large areas. This service includes planning, determination of ideal locations for treatment facilities, design and construction of septage treatment plant (SpTP) and conveyance, development of operational procedures, determination of effective number of desludging trucks, and operation and maintenance of SpTP and desludging trucks.</p>
